## About PhotoCulling

Hello!

If you have ideas, feedback, or suggestions about PhotoCulling, please reach out to me at thomeven@gmail.com. I'd love to hear from you.

### Background

I started RsyncOSX in August 2016 as a way to learn Swift, and after eight years of releases, it was archived in August 2024. RsyncUI, built with SwiftUI, began in late 2020 and continues to be actively developed. PhotoCulling represents my latest venture into building specialized macOS applications with modern Swift technologies.

I hold a master's degree in computing science, earned in the early 1990s when Linux and the public Internet were emerging. The Web itself was invented just a few years earlier, in 1989 at CERN. As a solo developer, I'm focused on creating stable, usable applications. I'm not a professional UI designer, so I appreciate user feedback that helps improve the interface.

I retired in May 2022 at age 62. Outside of coding, I'm an avid [bird photographer](https://birdsofprey.netlify.app) who spends time in the Norwegian mountains. Grandchildren, photography, and cross-country skiing keep me busy alongside my coding projects.

### Development Approach

Although I've worked as an IT professional for most of my career, much of that time was spent in IT management rather than hands-on development. My coding experience comes from personal projects like PhotoCulling, RsyncUI, and RsyncOSX. I've learned invaluably from documentation, online resources, and studying examples from other developers.

With every Swift, SwiftUI, and Xcode release, I continue learning and improving my craft. Major changes and updates are documented in the [changelog](/blog/releases/). I use quality assurance tools such as [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint), [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat), and [periphery](https://github.com/peripheryapp/periphery) to maintain high code standards.

### Build and Distribution

PhototCulling is built with Swift and SwiftUI, utilizing modern macOS APIs. The application is digitally signed and notarized by Apple to ensure security and integrity. This means you can trust that the application hasn't been tampered with and meets Apple's security standards.

### About This Website

This documentation is built with Hugo, a fast and flexible static site generator. The source code is hosted on GitHub, and Netlify automatically detects changes to the main branch, rebuilding the site within seconds. The theme used is [docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy), a clean and responsive documentation theme also hosted on GitHub.

This approach ensures the documentation is always up-to-date and easily maintainable.
