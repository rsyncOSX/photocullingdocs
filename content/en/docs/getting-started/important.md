## Before You Start

Please review these important points before using PhotoCulling for the first time.

### System Requirements

- **macOS Tahoe** or later
- **Apple Silicon** (M-series) or **Intel** Mac
- Sufficient disk space for your photo library

### Key Concepts

#### What is Photo Culling?

Photo culling is the process of reviewing a batch of images and selecting only the best ones to keep. This is an essential workflow for photographers who shoot in burst mode or take many photos during a session. Culling helps you:

- Eliminate out-of-focus or blurry shots
- Remove duplicates and similar frames
- Identify and separate high-quality "keeper" images
- Organize your photo library efficiently
- Reduce storage requirements

### Before You Start Culling

1. **Backup Your Photos**: Always maintain backups of your original photos before culling. PhotoCulling marks images for culling but ensure you have safe copies elsewhere.

2. **Understand Your Workflow**: Know your culling criteria before starting. What makes a good photo for you? What should be removed?

3. **Have Good Previews**: Ensure you have a fast, responsive system with adequate memory for smooth previewing of large batches of images.

4. **Use External Storage Wisely**: If working with photos on external drives, ensure they remain connected throughout your culling session.

### Privacy & Security

- PhotoCulling is a **local application only**—all your photos stay on your computer
- No data is uploaded to cloud services or third-party servers
- Your photo library is completely private and under your control
- The application is sandboxed for additional security

### Tips for Efficient Culling

1. **Work in Batches**: Don't try to cull thousands of photos in one session. Break it into manageable batches.

2. **Use Keyboard Shortcuts**: Learn the keyboard shortcuts for faster marking and navigation.

3. **Take Breaks**: Photo culling requires careful attention. Take regular breaks to maintain quality judgments.

4. **Be Decisive**: Make quick decisions on each photo. If you're unsure, mark for review later.

5. **Review Your Culls**: After marking photos, review your decisions before permanently removing any images.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- Ensure macOS Tahoe or later is installed
- Restart PhotoCulling if the interface becomes unresponsive
- Check that photos are stored in a supported format (JPEG, HEIF, RAW, etc.)
- Verify you have read/write permissions for photo directories
