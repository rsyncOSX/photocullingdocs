## Copying Photos with PhotoCulling

PhotoCulling supports two distinct copy workflows to fit your photo culling process:

1. **Initial Copy**: Copy your photos from your camera to a temporary catalog
2. **Final Copy**: Copy only your selected and rated photos to your final destination

Understanding both workflows is essential for an efficient culling workflow.

## Copy All Tagged Photos

The first workflow copies all photos that have been tagged during your culling process. This is useful when you want to copy a broad selection of marked images to your destination.

### Step 1: Tag Your Photos

As you review your images in PhotoCulling, tag all the photos you want to include in your copy operation.

### Step 2: Select Tagged Photos for Copy

Use PhotoCulling's filter to view and select all tagged photos, preparing them for the copy operation.

### Step 3: Copy Tagged Photos to Destination

Execute the copy operation to transfer all tagged photos to your destination folder.

## Copy Based on Rating

After rating your photos, use this workflow to copy only the images that meet your rating threshold. This is ideal for copying only your best-rated selections to your final destination.

### Step 1: Rate Your Photos

Review and rate your images in PhotoCulling, assigning ratings to indicate quality and value of each photo.

### Step 2: Filter by Rating

Use PhotoCulling's rating filter to display only photos that meet your minimum rating criteria for copying.

### Step 3: Copy Rated Photos to Destination

Execute the copy operation to transfer only your highly-rated photos to your final destination folder.

## Tips for Efficient Copying

- **Tagged vs. Rating**: Choose the copy method that best fits your workflow—tagged photos for broad selections or rating-based for quality-focused selections
- **Use Separate Folders**: Keep your temporary catalog separate from your final destination to avoid confusion
- **Name Your Catalogs**: Use descriptive names like "2026-02-01-Event-Tagged" or "2026-02-01-Event-Rated"
- **Verify Completion**: Always confirm that all images were successfully copied before deleting the source
- **Backup First**: Consider backing up your original camera files before the culling process begins

Now that you understand both copy workflows, you're ready to [cull your photos](/docs/getting-started/culling/) using PhotoCulling!
