## Getting Started with PhotoCulling

### What is a Photo Culling Application?

A photo culling application is specialized software designed to help photographers efficiently review, organize, and select the best images from a large collection. The primary goal is to:

- **Quickly filter** out-of-focus, blurry, or unwanted shots
- **Identify duplicates** and near-duplicate frames
- **Isolate high-quality keepers** for editing and post-processing
- **Organize your workflow** by marking and categorizing images
- **Save storage space** by removing unnecessary photos

PhotoCulling makes this process fast and intuitive, allowing you to cull hundreds of photos in a reasonable timeframe.

### Launching PhotoCulling

After installation, PhotoCulling appears in your Applications folder. Simply double-click to launch the application.

Once opened, the main interface presents you with options to browse and select a folder containing your photos.

### Opening Your Photo Folder

PhotoCulling works with any folder containing supported image formats:

- **JPEG** (.jpg, .jpeg)
- **HEIF** (.heif, .heic)
- **RAW formats** (Canon, Nikon, Sony, etc.)
- **PNG** (.png)
- **TIFF** (.tif, .tiff)

Use the folder selection dialog to navigate to your photo directory. PhotoCulling will scan and display all compatible images.

### The Interface

Once you've selected a folder, PhotoCulling displays your photo library in a clear, organized layout:

- **Main viewing area** shows your current photo and thumbnail grid
- **Navigation controls** allow you to move through your library
- **Marking tools** let you flag images for keeping or culling
- **Zoom controls** help you inspect details

### Next Steps

Continue to the [Culling Photos](/docs/getting-started/culling/) guide to learn how to mark, review, and finalize your culled collection.
