## Getting Started with PhotoCulling

### What is a Photo Culling Application?

A photo culling application is specialized software designed to help photographers efficiently review, organize, and select the best images from a photo shoot. The typical workflow is:

1. **Copy from Camera**: Images are copied from your camera to a temporary catalog on your Mac
2. **Review & Mark**: You review each image and mark the keepers you want to keep
3. **Rate Images**: Rate the marked photos based on quality and editing priority
4. **Copy Keepers**: Only the marked and rated photos are copied to a final catalog for editing
5. **Edit**: Use a dedicated photo editing application to edit the selected images

PhotoCulling makes this process fast and intuitive, allowing you to review hundreds of photos in a reasonable timeframe and prepare only your best shots for professional editing.

### Launching PhotoCulling

After installation, PhotoCulling appears in your Applications folder. Simply double-click to launch the application.

Once opened, the main interface presents you with options to browse and select a folder containing your photos.

### Opening Your Photo Folder

PhotoCulling works with any folder containing supported image formats:

- **JPEG** (.jpg, .jpeg)
- **HEIF** (.heif, .heic)
- **RAW formats** (Canon, Nikon, Sony, etc.)
- **PNG** (.png)
- **TIFF** (.tif, .tiff)

Use the folder selection dialog to navigate to your photo directory. PhotoCulling will scan and display all compatible images.

#### Automatic JPG Generation

PhotoCulling can create JPG files (approximately 1 MB each) from all RAW files in your temporary catalog. These JPGs are stored in a designated temporary location and can be viewed using the standard macOS Photo Viewer application, providing quick preview access without requiring a dedicated RAW viewer. This is particularly useful for fast browsing or sharing previews with colleagues during the culling process.

### The Interface

Once you've selected a folder, PhotoCulling displays your photo library in a clear, organized layout:

- **Main viewing area** shows your current photo and thumbnail grid
- **Navigation controls** allow you to move through your library
- **Marking tools** let you flag images for keeping or culling
- **Zoom controls** help you inspect details

### Next Steps

Continue to the [Culling Photos](/docs/getting-started/culling/) guide to learn how to mark, review, and finalize your culled collection.
