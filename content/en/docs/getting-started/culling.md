## How to Cull Your Photos

This guide walks you through the process of culling photos in PhotoCulling, from scanning your library to finalizing your selections.

### Step 1: Scanning Your Photo Library

When you first select a folder, PhotoCulling scans all images and generates previews. This process reads your photo metadata and creates a visual index of all images in the selected directory.

During scanning, you can monitor progress as the application indexes your images. Depending on the size of your library, this may take a few moments.

### Step 2: Post-Scan Display

Once scanning completes, PhotoCulling displays your full photo library with a thumbnail grid and preview controls ready for culling.

At this point, you can:
- Navigate through images using arrow keys or click navigation
- View the current image in the main preview area
- Mark images with your culling decisions
- Use filters to organize your view

### Step 3: Review and Mark Images

Examine each photo carefully. You can view images at normal size first to get a quick sense of quality.

#### Marking Photos

For each image, decide whether to keep or cull it:

- **Keep**: Mark high-quality photos that you want to retain
- **Cull**: Mark photos you want to remove
- **Review Later**: Mark questionable photos for later review

#### Keyboard Shortcuts

Use these keyboard shortcuts for efficient culling:

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Mark as Keep | <kbd>K</kbd> or <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> |
| Mark as Cull | <kbd>C</kbd> or <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd> |
| Toggle Review Later | <kbd>R</kbd> |
| Move to Next | <kbd>→</kbd> or <kbd>↓</kbd> |
| Move to Previous | <kbd>←</kbd> or <kbd>↑</kbd> |
| Zoom In | <kbd>+</kbd> or <kbd>Scroll Up</kbd> |
| Zoom Out | <kbd>-</kbd> or <kbd>Scroll Down</kbd> |

### Step 4: Inspect Details

For critical decisions, zoom in to examine fine details like focus, expressions, or technical quality.

Zoomed view allows you to:
- Check if eyes are sharp and in focus
- Verify composition details
- Look for artifacts or blemishes
- Confirm technical quality before keeping

This is especially useful when deciding between very similar shots from burst mode.

### Step 5: Review Your Culling

After marking all photos, take time to review your decisions:

1. **Filter by Status**: View only photos marked as "Cull" or "Review Later"
2. **Double-Check**: Re-examine borderline cases
3. **Adjust Marks**: Move any incorrectly marked photos to the right category

### Step 6: Finalize and Export

Once satisfied with your culling decisions:

1. **Delete Marked Photos**: Permanently remove photos marked as "Cull"
2. **Export Keepers**: Your "Keep" photos remain in place or can be organized into a separate folder
3. **Archive**: Create a backup of your culled collection

> **Important**: Before deleting any photos, ensure you have a complete backup of your original library stored safely elsewhere.

### Pro Tips for Efficient Culling

1. **Work in Sessions**: Cull in focused sessions rather than all at once. You'll make better decisions when fresh.

2. **Use Consistent Criteria**: Decide on your standards (sharpness, composition, exposure) before starting.

3. **Compare Burst Shots**: Use the grid view to compare similar shots side-by-side, selecting the best from each burst.

4. **Trust Your Instincts**: If you have doubts about a photo, mark it for review rather than keeping questionable shots.

5. **Check Metadata**: PhotoCulling can show image metadata (ISO, aperture, shutter speed) to help inform your decisions.

6. **Sort by Date**: Group photos by shooting date to maintain context during culling.

### What's Next?

Once you've culled your photos, you can:
- Continue with post-processing in your preferred editing software
- Organize keepers into collections or albums
- Create backup archives of your final selection
- Share your best work

Congratulations on completing your cull! You now have a curated collection of your best photos ready for the next steps in your photography workflow.
