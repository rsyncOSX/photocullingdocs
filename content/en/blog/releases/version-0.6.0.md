### Version 0.6.0 - Feb 3, 2026 (beta release)

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">

The previous issue has been resolved. The problem was related to the Sandbox entitlement of the application. The application is signed and notarized by Apple and is fully Sandboxed. It utilizes the default `/usr/bin/rsync` when copying files from source to destination. For further information, please refer to the user documentation. The application is non-destructive and only copies files, without any deletion.

Please verify the SHA 256 if you decide to try it out.
