### Version 0.5.0 - Feb 2, 2026 (beta release)

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">

A bug has been identified in the beta version of the software. It is currently only functional in the --dry-run mode, simulating a real copy without performing any actual actions. Further investigation will be conducted to resolve this issue. However, users who attempt to use the software in the --dry-run mode will gain a basic understanding of its functionality. I apologize for the inconvenience caused by the "--dry-only" bug. 


Please read the documentation before using the app.
